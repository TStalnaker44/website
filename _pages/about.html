                <p> Hey there! I'm Trevor Stalnaker, a Computer Science PhD student with a passion 
                    for education and a heart for service. I love teaching and helping others realize 
                    their full potential. As a Christian,  I value my relationships with friends and family
                     and enjoy creating memories that last a lifetime.  Learn more below.</p>

                    <p>As a passionate movie buff, nothing beats the magic of the theater experience. 
                        Whether it's the latest animated flick, an action-packed adventure, 
                        or a laugh-out-loud comedy, I'm always up for it. And as a die-hard Star Wars 
                        fan, I'll never tire of a galaxy far, far away. I also have a soft spot for 
                        movies that are so bad, they're good.</p>

                    <p>I'm a lifelong learner and love to share interesting facts with others. I strive 
                        to be well-versed in many areas and enjoy connecting with people through knowledge. 
                        Some even call me a modern-day polymath.</p>

                    <p>I'm a hands-on person who loves to building things. While I enjoy working in cyberspace, there's nothing 
                        like seeing a real world project come together before my eyes. Whether it's hanging drywall or building 
                        a bookshelf, I relish the opportunity to work with tools and hone my skills.</p>
