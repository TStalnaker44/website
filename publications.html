      <h2 class="section-header">A Comprehensive Study of Bills of Materials for Software Systems (Thesis)</h2>
      <!--<h3 class="published">Washington and Lee Library - 2023</h3>-->
      <div class="abstract">
        Software Bills of Materials (SBOMs) have emerged as tools to facilitate the management
         of software dependencies, vulnerabilities, licenses, and the supply chain.
        Significant effort has been devoted to increasing SBOM awareness and developing
        SBOM formats and tools. Despite this effort, recent studies have shown that SBOMs
        are still an early technology not adequately adopted in practice yet, mainly due to
        limited SBOM tooling and lack of industry consensus on SBOM content, tool usage,
        and practical benefits. Expanding on previous research, this thesis reports a 
        comprehensive study that first investigates the current challenges stakeholders encounter
        when creating and using SBOMs. The study surveyed 138 practitioners belonging to
        five groups of stakeholders (practitioners familiar with SBOMs, members of critical
        open source projects, AI/ML practitioners, experts of cyber-physical systems, and
        legal professionals), using differentiated questionnaires. We interviewed eight survey
        respondents to gather further insights about their experience. We identified fourteen
        major challenges facing the creation and use of SBOMs, including those related to
        the material included in SBOMs, deficiencies in SBOM tools, SBOM maintenance
        and verification, and domain-specific challenges. We propose and discuss six actionable
         solutions to the identified challenges and present the major avenues for future
        research and development. We hope these solutions can be adopted by the community
         to improve SBOM formats, tools, and adoption, and thus, enable the full
        potential of SBOMs.</div>

        <h2 class="section-header">Procedural Generation of Metroidvania Style Levels (Thesis)</h2>
        <h3 class="published">Washington and Lee Library - 2020</h3>
        <div class="abstract">Video game maps can become dull with repeated play-throughs and handcrafting 
            a variety of maps can be a tedious and time consuming process. This is especially true for games 
            of the Metroidvania genre, games which focus on exploration. If there was a way to adequately automate 
            the creation of levels, then in theory, the games would have enhanced replay value. Previous researchers 
            have used artificial intelligence and genetic programming techniques to engineer new mappings. But, is it 
            possible to procedurally generate levels using graph theory and without using training examples or simply 
            placing pre-built assets? In this paper we propose a system to model Metroidvania maps as directional graph 
            structures. The system uses an algorithm that crafts graphs meeting all of the constraints necessary for level
             generation. These generated graphs are verified as winnable with the keys assigned to appropriate nodes. Once 
             the graph has been created and validated it is rendered into a 2-D level using pygame. During the rendering 
             process, the game demo constructs the walls and platforms essential to the game. We were able to procedurally 
             generate Metroidvania levels of varying sizes and gating techniques using this sequence of steps.</div>
